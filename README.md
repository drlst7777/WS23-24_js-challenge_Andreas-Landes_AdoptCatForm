# WS23-24_js-challenge_Andreas-Landes_AdoptCatForm
Using JavaScript to add functions to the Cat Shelter Project from the CSS Challenge

Unfortunately, Maryam had to drop out, so Andreas is coding this on his own
Also unfortunate, but the relevant sections of JavaScript in the Udemy course come pretty late, so the first 2 weeks of the project no real work or planning could have gone into this. Anyway, doing my best to apply the newly learnt content in this short amount of time :-)
